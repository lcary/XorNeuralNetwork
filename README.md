This is a simple artificial neural network designed to improve performance on training an XOR function from scratch. This is inspired by the “Neural Net in C++ Tutorial” by David Miller.

Assumptions: the neural network is fully connected, implicitly connected, forward connected. Each neuron is fully connected to each neuron to the “right” (closer to the output) of it.

Features: back propagation as the method, gradient descent as the algorithm, and adjustable momentum.
